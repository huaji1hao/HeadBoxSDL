## Requirement 5: Complex intelligence on an automated moving object

### Attempted Tasks

- **Task c**: 

  - Description: A good implementation of some more complex algorithm
  - Implementation Details: When zombies move, in `Zombie::updateDirectionTowardsPlayer`, they will use my own adapted A* algorithm to search the next position and update their directions
  - Result:  Zombies will use my adapted A* algorithms to attack the player

- **Task d**: 

  - Description: An exceptional implementation

  - Implementation Details: 

    - **Problems:**

      In `Zombie::updateDirectionTowardsPlayer` , I first load the map information from `Scyjz14TileManager`into `Graph` and then pass the graph variable to `AStar` by reference to save time. 

      Because my tile size is 30 \* 40 and my player and zombie size are 45 \* 50, if I use the standard A* algorithm, it doesn't meet my agent's pathfinding needs due to a mismatch in size between the agent and the tiles. 

      The issue arises when the A* algorithm directs the agent downward, but a wall blocks the path, trapping the agent. The algorithm doesn't recognize the wall because of the size difference, leading to repeated blockages. 

      To address this, I modified part of the A* algorithm. I input the map positions of four points: the agentâ€™s center, the center offset by pixels to the left, the center offset to the right, and the player's center, into the algorithm. During neighbor initialization, I add the left neighbor of the left point, the right neighbor of the right point, and all common neighbors of these two points into the priority queue. 

      This widens the initial search area, providing more optimal paths and preventing the agent from getting stuck. 

    - **Elegance of the C++ code:**

      - **Use of Standard Template Library (STL):** 

        The function heavily utilizes components from the C++ Standard Template Library, including `std::pair`, `std::priority_queue`, and `std::unordered_map`. These tools are well-optimized for performance and provide a clear and concise way to handle complex data structures and algorithms efficiently.

      - **Lambda Expressions for Local Functionality:** 

        The use of a lambda expression, `addIfPassable`, encapsulates the logic for adding passable neighbors to the search frontier. This approach not only reduces code redundancy but also enhances the readability by keeping the neighbor-checking logic close to where it is applied. It allows for easy modification of the behavior of neighbor handling without affecting the rest of the algorithm's structure.

      - **Graph Abstraction:** 

        The algorithm interacts with the environment through a `Graph` object, which abstracts the details of node connectivity and passability. This separation of concerns ensures that the pathfinding logic is not tightly coupled with the data representation of the graph, making the code more modular and easier to maintain or extend.

      - **Dynamic Path Cost Calculation:** 

        Costs are dynamically calculated using the `Graph::cost(Point from, Point to)` function, which can be tailored to different types of terrain or movement penalties. This flexibility allows the algorithm to be adapted to various scenarios without rewriting the pathfinding logic.

      - **Efficient Path and Cost Management:** 

        The algorithm maintains two maps, `came_from` and `cost_so_far`, to track the path's progression and the cost associated with each point. This method is efficient in terms of both time and space, as it only stores necessary information and updates these structures as the path is built.

      - **Priority Queue for Frontier Management:** 

        The priority queue ensures that the node with the highest priority (lowest cost + heuristic) is always processed next, which is central to the efficiency of the A* algorithm. The `Node` structure, used within the priority queue, is a simple yet powerful way to pair each point with its priority, simplifying the management of the search frontier.

      - **Goal Check and Path Reconstruction:** 

        The loop exits when the goal is reached, preventing unnecessary computations. After finding the goal, the function reconstructs the path from the goal to the start using the `came_from` map and then determines the next step to take, demonstrating a clear use of reverse iteration over the path.

      - **Return Value as Movement Vector:** 

        Finally, the function returns a `std::pair<int, int>`, representing the movement vector from the start to the next step. This approach neatly encapsulates the result in a format that is easy to understand and use in further calculations or movements.

  - Result:  Overall, this code implements heuristic pathfinding for objects of different sizes in the map and the elegance of this C++ code lies in its efficient use of STL, clear separation of concerns, and its adaptability to different pathfinding requirements through dynamic cost calculations and flexible neighbor management.

## Requirement 6: Non-trivial pixel-perfect collision detection between objects

### Attempted Tasks

- **Task a**: 

  - Description: Improved collision detection which will work on more complex shapes
  - Implementation Details: In `Scyjz14CollisionDetection` I implement many function about check pixels with alpha channel
  - Result:  I can directly use these functions to check two images with transparency

- **Task b**: 

  - Description: pixel-perfect collision detection on an arbitrarily complex irregular shape

  - Implementation Details: I implement these in  `Scyjz14CollisionDetection` 

    ```c++
    // Check if two images collide by checking the pixels
    static bool checkPixel(
        Scyjz14Image image1, int iSourceX1, int iSourceY1, int width1, int height1, 
        int iScreenX1, int iScreenY1,
        Scyjz14Image image2, int iSourceX2, int iSourceY2, int width2, int height2, 
        int iScreenX2, int iScreenY2);
        
    // Expand the opaque part of image1 by `offset` pixels
    // and detect whether it collides with image2.
    static bool checkPixelWithOffset(int offSet,
        const Scyjz14Image& image1, int iSourceX1, int iSourceY1, 
        int width1, int height1, int iScreenX1, int iScreenY1,
        const Scyjz14Image& image2, int iSourceX2, int iSourceY2, 
        int width2, int height2, int iScreenX2, int iScreenY2);
    
    // Check if a image collides with a straight line
    static bool checkPixelWithStraightLine(
        Scyjz14Image image, int iSourceX, int iSourceY, 
        int width, int height, int iScreenX, int iScreenY,
        int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY);
    
    // Check if image2 is in image1
    static bool checkPixelIsImg2InImg1(
        Scyjz14Image image1, int iSourceX1, int iSourceY1, int width1, int height1, 
        int iScreenX1, int iScreenY1,
        Scyjz14Image image2, int iSourceX2, int iSourceY2, int width2, int height2, 
        int iScreenX2, int iScreenY2);
    ```

  - Result:  They are very useful. For instance, when the player kills all the zombies and need to go to the next level, I check whether the player moves to the door for all pixel by`checkPixelIsImg2InImg1`. I check the zombies and player collision by `checkPixelWithOffset`...

## Requirement 8: Have an animated or changing background by utilising multiple images

### Attempted Tasks

- **Task a**: 
  - Description: Have at least five drawing surfaces, set up with at least slightly different contents
  - Implementation Details: In `LoseState`, I draw a slightly floating soul for the player to indicate that the player has died. I use `std::vector<DrawingSurface>` to manage the background surfaces and avoid redundant code. At the same time, I use `m_iSwitchThreshold` and `m_iSwitchCounter` to make the changing rate slower rather than slower down the frame rate
  - Result:  The changes look smooth

## Requirement 9: Correctly implement scrolling and zooming of the foreground, allowing the user to scroll around using keys and/or mouse

### Attempted Tasks

- **Task a**: 
  - Description: Allow a player to scroll the screen by using keys
  - Implementation Details: In `InstructionState::virtKeyDown(int iKeyCode)`,  the user can use `SDLK_LEFT`, `SDLK_RIGHT`, `SDLK_UP` and `SDLK_DOWN` to scrolly move the instruction board and use `SDLK_SPACE` to restore the window's position
  - Result:  The foreground can be scrolled by keys
- **Task b**: 
  - Description: Allow a player to zoom in and out the foreground by mouse
  - Implementation Details: In `InstructionState::virtMouseWheel(int x, int y, int which, int timestamp)`, the player can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out the instruction board where the mouse is pointed. To implement these two functions, I create my own `Scyjz14FilterPoints` class. It inherits from `FilterPointsTranslation` and is composed of a `FilterPointsScaling` so this class allows the engine to zoom and pan at the same time.
  - Result:  If the player cannot clearly see the word on the board, this may be useful..

## Requirement 10: Animate moving objects

### Attempted Tasks

- **Task b**: 
  - Description: Your objects should have animated rather than fixed appearances
  - Implementation Details:  In `SpriteObject`, I implement `SpriteObject::updateAnimationFrame(int iCurrentTime)` to update the animation frame for current time. The principle is that the image is loaded as sprite sheet, and I force each `SpriteObject` to override a `getFrameCount()` to represent the number of frames in the sprite sheet by make it virtual. Every time the object is updated, `m_iCurrentFrameX` and `m_iCurrentFrameY` will also be updated if the time difference from the last update exceeds `iElapsedTime`. In `virtDraw()`, the object is drawn using the source position calculated from the current frame.
  - Result:  The agent objects move smoothly in the `RunningState`

## Requirement 11: Image rotation/manipulation using the `ImagePixelMapping` object

### Attempted Tasks

- **Task a**: 
  - Description: Creating and using your own `ImagePixelMapping` class and draw at least one object to the screen
  - Implementation Details:  I create `ImagePixelMappingFlip`, it inherits from `ImagePixelMapping`, which can flip images horizontally, vertically, and both horizontally and vertically. In `StartUpState::virtSetupBackgroundBuffer()`, I draw a red pin on the top right of the photo frame and I horizontally flip the red pin and draw it on the top left of the photo frame
  - Result:  It makes the background look nice
